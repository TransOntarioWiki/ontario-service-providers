This includes using a trauma-informed, body positive, and inclusive approach. You deserve care that is specific to you and your body, not a one-size-fits-all approach.",

Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) are primary healthcare providers who support and stimulate the body’s ability to heal itself, using natural substances and treatments which include acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, nutritional and lifestyle counselling.. Naturopathic Medicine blends our evolving scientific knowledge with traditional, natural forms of medicine. The naturopathic philosophy is to stimulate the healing power of the body and treat the underlying cause of disease. Symptoms are seen as signs of imbalanced functioning of the body and can be the result of unfavourable lifestyle habits. Naturopathic Doctors treat the entire continuum of illness – they can provide relief for the acute manifestations of disease, such as pain and infection, and they can treat the underlying causes of chronic illness, creating the opportunity for full healing and the restoration of health & vitality.\nAs a primary healthcare provider, NDs can address a wide variety of health problems in every stage of life, from obstetrics to geriatrics.\nDr. Cowan ND practices in Gravenhurst and Orillia, ON.

I perform assessments, conduct treatment, and consult to individuals, couples, families, and organizations. My approach to treatment is relational and psychodynamic: I aim to get a deeper understanding of thoughts and feelings, experiences and interactions that may not really be in tune with what you want: how you want to be and how you want to live your life. With assessments, we aim to investigate strengths and weaknesses, what helps and what impedes, to find out what is going on and what works best for you. I aim for cultural sensitivity and sexual orientation support. We work together to develop practical solutions.",

The curriculum ensures that beginning in Year I, and increasingly throughout the program, students learn to integrate and apply theoretical knowledge to clinical practice, patient care and management.\nTaught in a series of four modules per academic year, courses and content are layered over single or multiple modules to facilitate the essential integration of knowledge, skill and practice.\nIn Year I and Year II, students build their foundation of knowledge in basic sciences and pathology for clinical skills and decision making while also getting hands on experience through courses in chiropractic skills, diagnosis and symptomatology, orthopaedics and diagnostic imaging.\nYear III emphasizes knowledge integration through the use of case-based clinical material to prepare students for internship in the CMCC clinics.\nYear IV is a 12 month clinical internship in two of CMCC’s clinical settings where interns provide direct care and education to patients under the supervision of a licensed chiropractor. Year IV students also engage laboratory clerkships and advanced diagnostic imaging, public health and business management.",

They are available to clients 24 hours a day, seven days a week by pager.\nIn Ontario, if you see a midwife you will not see a physician unless there are concerns or complications. Most births are normal and there are no complications. If there are complications, midwives can consult or transfer care to a physician.

    "description": "The overall mission of EBT3 is to provide high-quality psychological services that have been found to work based on scientific research (i.e., evidence-based). There are three types of evidence-based services that we offer, including therapy, training clinicians in psychological assessment and treatment, and psychological testing and comprehensive assessment. We strive to provide these services with a client-centered focus that takes into account issues of individual diversity.\nConnection, trust, and comfort are key ingredients in a good relationship with a therapist. Evidence-based therapy is no different; therapists strive to see your unique perspective and understand exactly where you are coming from. What is often overlooked, however, are the specific kinds of treatment a clinic or particular therapist has to offer.\nWhen people think of therapy, they may imagine the popular notion of digging deep into their past, or analyzing their relationships with their parents. While these methods can be helpful, they are not always relevant and often require a long term commitment that lasts months or even years. Since time, money, and concrete results are often priorities, evidence-based therapies can be the most efficient and effective options.\nWhat does it mean to say that therapies are “evidence-based” or “scientifically tested?” It means that large groups of people have received these therapies from trained therapists who work closely with researchers. These researchers analyze how well the therapy works during the course of treatment and in the weeks, months and sometimes years following the end of therapy. By analyzing the results of these studies, researchers and therapists are able to figure out what worked in a particular therapy and what didn’t. Suggestions for improving the therapy are made and are then implemented in new studies where the results are again tested. This is the essence of evidence-based therapy; the “evidence” is simply the scientific evidence that these therapies can work. While there is never a guarantee that a particular therapy will be effective for a particular person, using evidence-based approaches greatly increases the chances of success.\nNot all mental health services are evidence-based and, thus, are not equally effective. For this reason, it is in your best interest to be educated when searching for a therapist. Psychologists at EBT3 use techniques that are based on recent research evidence. Since therapies are constantly evolving and changing as more research is done, we make sure to continually update our skills and knowledge. This allows us to select the techniques that are most likely to help our clients address their specific problems. Therapists using evidence-based approaches also carefully assess their clients’ progress over the course of therapy to make sure that the treatment plan is leading to desired outcomes. These assessments are also evidence-based, meaning that research has shown that the assessment tools reliably measure what they are intended to measure.\nEvidence-based therapy is generally short-term and problem-focused, with positive changes often experienced within 8 – 20 sessions. At EBT3, clinicians have training and expertise in several evidence-based therapies.",

When we face trauma or hardship, the brain does a brilliant job of adapting to keep us safe, and it adopts whatever beliefs and behaviours are necessary to get us through. If you’re reading this, it’s likely that you’ve notice some of your own beliefs and behaviours holding you back from the life you really want to live. You are far from alone in this. Often, the beliefs and behaviours that keep us safe and functioning at one point in our lives stop being helpful, and may even start wreaking havoc on our ability to be the person we really want to be.\nI’m passionate about walking alongside you in your search for meaning and change. I look forward to hearing your story, and compassionately supporting you to understand the patterns that have you feeling stuck. Together, we can uncover how your experiences have shaped how you show up in the world today, process the things that have happened to you, explore your current emotions and relationships, and navigate towards a life that feels fulfilling.\nI aim to provide a warm, safe, and comfortable environment for connection, self-exploration, and sharing of your authentic self. I strive to meet you where you’re at, fostering a therapeutic relationship of collaboration and acceptance. I adopt anti-oppressive, trauma-informed, strengths-based, and client-centred approaches in my work.",

Traumatic experiences tend to stay locked in our bodies and minds until they can be released. EMDR has been found to be particularly effective at facilitating healing and growth. It is remarkable for its ability to move disturbing memories into the past so they no longer affect the person. It is focused on bringing together the images, thoughts, feelings, and body sensations of person’s experience. Working with the body and mind together is key in overcoming trauma. She received her Level I and II trainings in Boston and Chicago from EMDR Humanitarian Assistance Program.\nShe believes in a holistic approach and encourages clients to supplement their therapy with exercise, yoga, nutrition awareness and mindfulness based practice. As a holistic therapist, her goal is to help clients uncover their true potential and discover greater confidence and self-awareness along their journey. She has been fortunate to work with many diverse clients over the years, each of whom has contributed to her learning and development.",

As a Psychotherapist, I have worked with a number of individuals ranging from ages 7 – 65+ from various ethnic backgrounds to help them work through a variety of issues. I have experience working with those in the LGBTQ community and marginalized groups.\nI have close to 10 years of experience working in various settings (hospital, private practice, correctional facilities). I normally approach much of my work from a Cognitive Behavioral or Dialectical Behavioral approach – but as each client and their concerns are unique in its’ own way, I am also quite versatile in my approach.\nOne of the most difficult yet courageous steps when seeking therapy is reaching out. I strongly believe that no significant therapeutic progress can be achieved without first having a strong therapeutic relationship with your client.

    "description": "Thinking about therapy but not sure about all that “talking”? I got you!\nArt Therapy is a unique and well-studied style of Psychotherapy, which is: the process of working on your thoughts, feelings and emotions to be the best version of you!\nWhat I love about Art Therapy as an approach to your wellbeing, is it’s not a box (because neither are you), and we can build a plan of care that supports your wants, your needs and critically what’s most important to you.\nI have to say, art and creativity helped me through some pretty harsh times throughout my life and to this day I still turn to the canvas to process lessons, changes and hardships; because it’s mine, it’s what is meaningful to me. I also don’t have to hold a conversation with a stranger for a whole hour (EXHAUSTING!).\nThe other thing I really like about art therapy is that creative expression of our struggles or dis-ease helps to be seen and heard; art and art therapy allow us to see into our thoughts or feelings, to externalize our inner experiences, all while strengthening growth and resilience.\n**Sex therapy!?** Talking about sex and sexuality is not something we often consider when we begin therapy. Yet, these are very important part of ourselves and relationships. I take a values based approach to talking about sex, so that you can feel more comfortable bringing that Whole Self into the therapy room, and feel confident your therapist has the skills to support you. I work with all identities and relationship styles (LGBTQ2S+, Polyamory, Kink, etc.)\nIf you’re curious to know more about how art therapy or sex therapy might be a fit for what ails ya – please book a consultation or send me an email! I look forward to meeting you and growing with you!\nCheers,\nHeidi\n#Certifications\nHeidi is a Registered Psychotherapist (RP) and a Registered Canadian Art Therapist (RCAT), an Associate member of the Board of Examiners in Sex Therapy and counselling in Ontario (BESTCO).\n#Areas of Special Interest\nADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), DID, teens and youth (14+), self-esteem, gender and identity development, sexual and relationship minorities, LGBTQ2S+",

It is important to release shame and to recognize that we are both spiritual beings and human beings and we are interconnected through our mind, body and soul. Sometimes we are too much in our mind and not enough in our body. Our bodies never lie, they speak our truth. If we are to heal, we have to accept our past and make it conscious. We must stop blaming it and acting out. Our past needs to be recognized, accepted, forgiven and put to rest, so we may rest.

Providing support to the parents, partners, adult children and families of LGBT people is also a particular interest for me. My own grown children have certainly challenged me in all kinds of unexpected ways.\nAs an out (and visible) transgendered man, my office can feel particularly comfortable for a wide range of trans people. I work to create a protected space where clients can explore their gender without preconceptions or pressure in any direction from me. I also have considerable knowledge of how others have navigated these complex issues–and the medical system — to reach some place of comfort and good health that works for them.\nI am also familiar and comfortable with a range of Queer communities, including Queer communities of Colour, polyamorous or other negotiated non-monogamous relationships, and Leather/BDSM communities.\nI work within a feminist and anti-oppression framework, though I hope I am never didactic. I have training in a wide range of modalities, from Gestalt through Rogerian, from Jungian dreamwork to current mainstream theories. These days I find myself particularly interested in Narrative thinking. Overall it remains my belief (supported by much research) that theoretical background matters much less than the quality of relationship between therapist and client.",

    "description": "As a disabled person who has worked in the mental health and the social service sector for over ten years, I know that there is a lack of mental health support for sick/disabled folks and the general care that does exist is not disability competent. Ableism is a profound barrier to accessing the life we want as disabled and sick folks, ableism runs through all parts of our lives – medical ableism from doctors, lack of support for our hopes and dreams from family because “you’re too disabled to do that,” physical barriers to our classrooms or workplaces and internalized ableism that comes from ourselves when we start believing what society is telling us. Internalized ableism can make us feel not worthy of love, support, work, school, relationships, pets, friends and a purpose in life.\nI offer mental health support to people with disabilities and chronic illnesses. As we all know our wellbeing is a combination of all parts of our lives including our mental health. Often mental health takes a backseat when managing chronic illness or disability, but it needs attention too.\nI work with a healing justice and trauma informed approach. I acknowledge how various oppressions and identities intersect and can affect our wellbeing. I see my role as a counselor as an ally in supporting you in your own work. I am here to witness your growth, to help you notice your own behaviors and patterns and to hold space for you to feel and process. I want you to be able to connect to your own values and dreams, to be empowered to know what is you and what society is “expecting” of you.\nIn addition to supporting disabled and/or chronically ill folks I work with parents, siblings and caretakers.  As an adult, I understand the amount of stress that having a sick child can put on parents, as well as siblings. I offer a listening and empathic place where you can get support for your unique needs as well. Disability doesn’t just affect the individual, it can affect folks around us too.\nAll of the counseling is done over video chat. I offer a free 20 minute “meet and greet” to see if we would be a good fit. Sessions are sliding scale $50-75. I work outside of the medical model and therefore do not qualify for insurance reimbursements.",

    "description": "Smooth Transitionz is a program catered to providing pre- and post-surgical care for individuals who are undergoing/pursuing gender affirming surgery. Individuals who experience gender incongruence (GI) typically fall through cracks in the medical system when attempting to regain quality of life after surgery. Including massage therapy into the circle of care during this rehabilitation period decreases inflammation and swelling, decreases pain, increases range of motion, and improves scar mobility and aesthetics. Many individuals are living with the joy of finally having the gender affirming body they desire, however, are suffering with the unnecessary restrictions that exist with post-surgical trauma.\nSmooth Transitionz aims to bridge the gap from hospital to home and reduce/eliminate the discomforts and restrictions that are unique to this community. The high-quality and trauma informed services offered extend to all states of chest-specific concerns including: binding, top-surgery and breast augmentation.

With this knowledge I was able to work my way through 8 years of competitive bodybuilding. Having achieved the provincial ranks and placing a respectable 2nd in my weight class, I then chose to retire to raise my young family. It is with this same knowledge that I continue to maintain a healthy life, encourage my children and through my leadership skills inspire and mentor many others to do the same.\nIf there is an area of your life that you know needs some managing and you are unsure where to start, I can help you personally or direct you to the service/product that can.\nMy interest is to help people manage their lives with no barriers and with confidentiality.",

There is no cost for Maryvale services although parents and legal guardians are asked to cover the costs of their child’s personal expenses.\nIt is Maryvale’s passion to promote the recognition and understanding that one’s inner mental and emotional world is of utmost importance and determines more than any other factor the quality of one’s current life and future life.",

    "description": "Gender Affirming Voice and Communication Training\nIf you are interested in finding or developing your most authentic voice, and keeping your voice healthy and sustainable while you do, I am happy to work with you.  Our work together can help you find a voice and communication style that feel both comfortable and authentic, and that you feel reflect your gender identity and are congruent with your gender expression.  As a registered speech-language pathologist, you may find that our sessions are covered by your supplemental insurance, as well.\nHere is some information about my approach to gender affirming voice and communication training (also sometimes referred to as “transgender voice therapy”):\nMost people want to know if I can help them find a higher or lower pitch. Therapy with me certainly can involve raising or lowering the pitch of your voice (depending on your goals), but it also often involves working on making your voice lighter (often perceived as a more feminine sound) or deeper (often perceived as a more masculine sound), and in all cases, more resonant and less effortful. Working on your voice doesn’t mean you have to conform to culturally-defined societal expectations of gender; these are just some of the aspects of finding a more authentic voice that many clients have expressed they want to work toward. Voice therapy with me also includes working on the other aspects of communication that help get your message across, such as the way you use your body when you communicate, the kinds of words and phrases you choose, and the way you express yourself. As well, we will explore how you would like to express your gender identity through voice and communication, examining together what makes the most authentic voice for you.\nI typically start with an in-depth 1-hour assessment session, where I get the chance to learn more about you and your goals, which helps me design the most effective approach to voice work for each individual person. Therapy sessions are typically between 30 minutes and an hour long, and often go in blocks of a few weeks’ worth of weekly or bi-weekly sessions, followed by a break for you to work on what we have explored and learned together. This is often followed up with another block of sessions to build on what you are learning and practicing. However, the length of individual sessions and how long we work together is always determined by a combination of your goals, how your voice changes from session to session, and how much support you feel you need, and this is a conversation we will always have together. Sessions may involve speaking, listening, writing, thinking, expressing, and reflecting on your work with your new voice, and they always involve practicing what you are learning and evaluating how you are feeling about your voice.\nI am proud of my connection to the LGBTQ2S+ community, and I maintain relationships with a variety of people, care providers, and resources that partner wonderfully with the work you’re doing on your voice. I’m also proud of my efforts to stay on top of the current best practices in voice therapy and in particular, in gender spectrum voice and communication work. I’ve taken a ton of supplemental training in this area, and I often present workshops and mentor SLPs who are new to this area of practice because I firmly believe we need more competent, confident, caring clinicians in this area, and I’m more than happy to help us all get there together.",

My treatment specialties include depression, anxiety, PTSD, relationship issues, substance use/addictions and grief/loss and HIV/AIDS. For over 20 years, I have provided  mental health services to members of LGBT2SQ communities, including 10 years providing support to people living with HIV/AIDS. I am well-versed with a range of mental health issues affecting members of LGBT2SQ communities, including disclosure, stigma, discrimination, health equity, transition, substance use and positive sexuality.\nAt New Connections (NC), you are at the centre of your recovery. You are the expert on your life. I work with you to mobilize the natural healing force that already resides within your mind-body system. Moreover, I believe that the meaning and importance of your mental health cannot be defined simply by a diagnosis or a set of symptoms. I provide counselling services that foster critical dialogue and facilitate an exploration of your mental health in all its dimensions: cultural, social, physical, sexual, emotional and spiritual. This involves developing the self-knowledge, resources and abilities that foster adaptive ways of relating to yourself and others. Making new connections is essential to increasing your resilience, your capacity to bend and flow: a step-by-step path that leads to creating positive change through self-awareness, self-acceptance and self-determination. I am here to share your journey toward equanimity, balance and peace of mind.\nHow you are uniquely connected (or not) to yourself, others and your communities is fundamentally important to my approach. I employ a range of therapeutic practices and principles to create an approach that facilitates health-restoring connections in your life. I fit the therapy around you rather than trying to fit you into the therapy. I help to identify counselling goals that are relevant and useful to you with respect to moving forward in your life. Through a dialogic, client-centred process, I explore the meanings and impacts of your mental health experiences, including past, present and future challenges. Deepening your understanding of your mental health is an essential first step in creating positive personal change.",

    "description": "The Ontario Aboriginal HIV/AIDS Strategy was implemented in 1995 and has consistently evolved since then to respond to the changing epidemic within the Aboriginal population. The Strategy has embraced two fundamental principles since its inception. The first being a recognition that OAHAS is a distinct strategy based on the distinct needs of Aboriginal people.\nWhile issues and factors related to the disease may be similar to the mainstream population, Aboriginal differences must be respected. This principle is embodied in the Two Row Wampum Treaty of the Haudenosaunee people.\nOasah has a variety of services within urban populations including education and training. Oahas staff will work with community members and families to access the basic needs for optimal health, including income, housing, food, employment and positive working conditions as well as providing safer sex and harm reduction supplies within the community.",

    "description": "My approach involves treating every client with respect, compassion, empathy, understanding and acceptance, no matter what their identity is.\n…\nLGBTQ2S+ individuals should not have to ‘defend’ themselves to society, nor educate others on their identities. Awareness is key, but so is acceptance of queer and trans people. However, given systemic discrimination – soul-crushing macroaggressions and microaggressions – are part of everyday life. Stereotyping and violence are all too common in a country we call “safe” like Canada.\n“Isms” can take place in everyday spaces, at work or even in medical settings. When we are not able to express our opinions, reveal our emotions, and share our experiences, our feelings are stored and manifested in the body, leading to chronic pain and other somatic experiences (i.e., jaw clenching, teeth grinding). Repressed emotions may be good for others, but they are detrimental to our well-being. That’s where therapy comes in as a confidential space to paint a true picture of your lived experience. Nothing is too big or too small to bring up in therapy.\nI do not support toxic positivity and strongly believe that Canada has a lot of work to do when it comes to human rights.\n…\nAs an RP (Qualifying) at Your Story Counselling Services, I provide an open space to share your unfiltered thoughts, opinions, and experiences. Let’s challenge the dominant discourse together.\nSliding scale rates are available for both virtual and in-person counselling. The office is located in Vaughan, accessible by public transit.\n…\nUse the website link to schedule a free 15-minute consult.",

We all live in the context of much larger systems and multiple relationships that inevitably have an impact on how we experience the world.\n​In my conversations with clients, I keep this vital piece at the forefront of my mind as we continue with the therapeutic work.\n​Also, I draw from different therapeutic modalities in order to best fit your needs. As an integrative therapist, my influences come from Collaborative Therapy, Solution Focused Brief Therapy, Narrative Therapy, Gottman Method Couple Therapy, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy and Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy.\n​As an individual who holds different roles and identities, I recognize the difficulties and hardships that can be uncovered when navigating different systems.\nI have both personal, and professional experience in navigating systemic barriers, along with experiences of oppression and marginalization.\nAs a therapist, it is my goal to uphold my values and beliefs in the work that I do with my clients. I believe in being honest and authentic as a person, while also being skilled, knowledgeable, and resourceful as a clinician.\nI strive to maintain an open and honest dialogue with my clients in a way that speaks to who we are and honours our experiences. I do not believe in a robotic or prescriptive way of being. Rather, it is my hope that in every interaction that I have with clients I am able to do so in the most human way possible. In a way that highlights honesty, advocacy, and empathy, while also upholding your dignity and decency as a human being.",

My practice as a Massage Therapist is grounded in more than five years of experience in the social work field where I became acutely aware of the ways that social factors impact people’s bodies.\nUsing massage therapy, I encourage soft tissues and joints to realign. In this way, the body is given an opportunity to use it’s own restorative wisdom. I work within my client’s comfort level to bring calm and healing to people experiencing a range of issues including chronic pain, sports or other injuries, headaches and migraines, and chronic musculoskeletal conditions. I also understand Massage Therapy to be preventative in its ability to increase well-being through general relaxation treatments and alignment maintenance.\nMy practice is body positive, and queer and trans welcoming. I strive to make massage therapy accessible by fostering supportive and caring relationships with the people I work with.",

Specializing in trauma informed care, issues of mental health and substance misuse.\nDESCRIPTION\nI am a queer and trans identified counsellor who has been working in the field of mental health and addictions counselling, therapy and support for the past 13 years.\nMy social work practice is clinical in nature, providing therapy to individuals that centers and affirms unique experiences and strengths. I work to help folks feel safe to discuss the issues and barriers they face and establish goals for change.\nMy counselling training and practice is wholly derived from my ability to listen to the individual as the expert of their experience. I believe the most powerful healing and change come from affirmative relationships that acknowledge the power of an individual to tell and understand their own story. I strive to provide a non-judgmental, safe and reflexive space that centers your unique experience, while also identifying the impacts of systemic and individual traumas and stresses on your ability to cope and function. We will co-create a space wherein you feel safe to explore issues of concern to you, identify goals for increasing your ability to cope with distress, function better, and begin to externalize shame and stigma collected in the body and spirit.\nThe approach that I use will be specifically catered to your experience and needs, and may be seen to infuse CBT, Narrative, Solution Focussed and Harm Reduction techniques within a larger model of anti-oppressive, trauma informed, holistic therapy.\nAREAS OF SPECIALIZATION AND INTEREST:\nConcurrent Disorders (co-occurring mental health and addictions issues)\nSubstance Misuse\nSerious and persistent mental health concerns including\nSchizophrenia, Bi-Polar, Major Depression, Social Anxiety &\nAgoraphobia, Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, OCD\nDepression and Anxiety\nTrauma therapy\nIncreasing coping strategies\nManaging anger\nRelationships\nNavigating stigma associated with queer and trans identities\nAccessing trans positive health care\nDiverse gender experiences and presentations\nSex positive, sex work positive, kink positive, poly positive",

    "description": "You’ve spent years hiding your emotional pain away from yourself, struggling with life’s challenges, and perhaps experiencing a sense of “stuckness” in your life. As someone who has been on my own path to healing, I recognize the courage and strength it takes to reach to someone for help.\nI meet you where you are – another human being in the room. You can expect to find a warm, calm space with empathetic listening. A compassionate space for collaboratively exploring your healing. Psychotherapy offers the chance for pinpointing the emotional pain that we’ve so effectively hidden away from ourselves. Allow me to accompany you with empathy and compassion as you overcome “stuckness” in your life.\nI have experience in assisting with: anger, depression, anxiety, insomnia, relationship issues, school challenges and other life’s struggles. Although there are no guarantees in therapy, clients can expect to develop stronger self-awareness of the underlying hurt, learn to recognize and validate pain as it arises and learn skills for comforting and soothing the self. I want to help you achieve fullness of life, purpose and meaning. I welcome you to check out my website for more information.",

Volunteers will undergo extensive training and will build capacity around leadership and community engagement, while program participants will be supported and empowered in their caregiving roles in a safe, welcoming environment that meets their individual needs. SPRINT Senior Care will facilitate a combination of formal and informal peer support, incorporating opportunities for education and resource sharing; as well as enabling organic relationship building between the volunteers and participants who can connect in a way that works best for them (in-person, phone, video and/or online chat). In order to achieve project sustainability, a toolkit will be created and shared with other senior-serving organizations seeking to deliver a similar program. This project will take place in Toronto and is facilitated in English. If you are interested please contact The Community Program Lead at 416-481-0669 Ext. 295, Priynka.patil@sprintseniorcare.org",

Osteopathic manual practitioners\nunderstand that the body functions as a unit, is capable of self-healing and self-regulation, and that the body’s ability to\nfunction is based upon its structural integrity. Through gentle manipulation, practitioners aim to restore movement\nwhere it has been lost and improve the quality of arterial, venous, nervous and lymphatic flow. By removing\nobstructions to this flow, the body demonstrates an amazing ability to heal.\nWho Can Benefit?\nOsteopathy can help individuals of any age, with both acute and chronic ailments. While osteopathic manual\npractitioners do not specifically treat diagnoses or medical conditions, osteopathic care can reduce symptoms and improve overall health. Some ailments that may benefit from osteopathic treatment include: acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain, sports injuries, repetitive strain injuries, headaches, breathing issues, digestive complaints, male and female reproductive issues, fatigue and difficulty sleeping.",

    "description": "Hello and thank you for inquiring about my services. I offer counselling and psychotherapy services for a range of issues including: grief, loss, anxiety, depression, loneliness, isolation, trauma, sexuality, gender identity & transitions, body image, relationships, adolescence, addictions, life transitions, and existential issues such as death, dying, and the search for meaning. I am warm, non-judgmental, open-minded, and queer/trans positive.\nI offer a sliding scale to clients who require a reduced fee for counselling services and our initial phone consultation together is free.\nMy counselling style is best described as person-centered, which means I follow the agenda of the client. I view clients as the experts of their own lives while I consider myself a consultant within their journeys toward enhanced wellness, strength, and joy.\nI employ tools and techniques from a number of different counselling models and approaches. Models I tend to use most often are solution-focused brief therapy, narrative therapy, emotion-focused therapy, and mindfulness-based therapy.\nFor many of us, our cultures, races, abilities, ages, sexualities, and genders are often compared to societal norms, which, in turn, labels many of our diversities as abnormal or other. Over time, such marginalization of our identities can affect how we experience the world and ourselves, often causing feelings of loss, isolation, and disempowerment. I approach these issues by working with clients from within a feminist perspective and an anti-oppressive framework which helps to facilitate the re-discovery of strengths and the courage to embrace diversity with empowerment, self-love, and confidence.\nMy goal within our work together is to genuinely listen to you and ask the right questions, which helps us to understand your pain together and to mutually identify your strengths, coping skills, hopes, and desired future. I respect that this is your personal journey and I feel privileged to be a witness to your growth, change, and self-discovery.",

Chronic stress, trauma, illness, relational challenges, systemic oppression, and the pressures of capitalism shape both our well-being and our attempts to get well. In welcoming this understanding, we can begin to uncover the deeper questions of your healing work.\nMy approach to psychotherapy is intuitive, deeply compassionate, and rooted in commitment to anti-oppression and social justice.  I value a highly collaborative approach: together, we can explore who and how you are in the world, and where you wish to go.  Working at the pace you set, we can strengthen your connection to self, and to the deep inner wisdom that will create the blueprint for your healing journey.",

It is incredibly important that you choose someone you connect with, can learn to trust, and believe in. With this in mind I offer the first session for free so that you can come in and see if we are a good fit.\nLots of us struggle with challenges that come up at various times in our lives. Sometimes it is one major event and sometimes it is many small events that can be overwhelming in time. Either way, accessing talk therapy as a means of being heard, organizing your thoughts, gaining clarity, and getting motivated is a healthy way of managing during those times that seem utterly unmanageable.\nOur goal at the Heitmann Centre is to support individuals in distress to regain their equilibrium, hope, self-esteem and joy. We support people in finding a way to accept where they are in this moment (rather than where they wish they were or think they should be) and take the steps necessary to help them move closer to the life they want to live",

It has one of the largest treatment spot sizes, making treatments convenient and fast. The combination of efficacy, patient comfort and speed make DiolazeXL a leader in laser hair removal. It is powerful enough to target and treat even the most stubborn hair.\nWHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?\nUnlike traditional methods (waxing, shaving, bleaching or using depilatory creams), DiolazeXL laser hair removal impacts the root of the problem, rather than offering a temporary solution. Traditional methods will require treatment forever, while DiolazeXL only requires a few sessions. Most patients immediately notice a significant reduction in hair growth and eventually smooth and hair-free skin.\nWHICH AREAS OF THE BODY CAN BE TREATED?\nDiolazeXL can be safely used on most areas of the body that have unwanted hair. Most commonly treated areas include bikini, legs, arms, chest, back, shoulders, stomach, neck, chin and sideburns.\n",

    "description": "Smooth Transitionz is a program catered to providing pre- and post-surgical care for individuals who are undergoing/pursuing gender affirming surgery. Individuals who experience gender incongruence (GI) typically fall through cracks in the medical system when attempting to regain quality of life after surgery. Including massage therapy into the circle of care during this rehabilitation period decreases inflammation and swelling, decreases pain, increases range of motion, and improves scar mobility and aesthetics. Many individuals are living with the joy of finally having the gender affirming body they desire, however, are suffering with the unnecessary restrictions that exist with post-surgical trauma. Smooth Transitionz aims to bridge the gap from hospital to home and reduce/eliminate the discomforts and restrictions that are unique to this community. The high-quality and trauma informed services offered extend to all states of chest-specific concerns including: binding, top-surgery and breast augmentation. Compassionate pricing options available at Toronto Community Massage & Wellness!",

We have no janitorial or kitchen staff – residents and frontline staff do it all. We keep the peace and get the dishes done. We run a tight ship with good values – like any good home!\nOur Frontline Support Workers manage a caseload of up to 10 residents, providing one-to-one support assisting in the advancement of their personal action plans for stability and independence.

I have a passion for the human mind, which has led me to a BA in psychology from Carleton University and a graduate certificate in victimology from Algonquin College and Dubrovnik University.\nThroughout my life, I have dealt with the challenges and pressures of being a first-generation Canadian and wrestling with mental health challenges. My experiences have led me to work with the Ottawa Rape Crisis Centre and the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime, where I listened to clients in a 2SLBGTQ safe space with compassion, empathy and unconditional positive regard. I believe the client is the expert in their lives, and I am ecstatic to collaborate in taking small steps towards meaningful change using narrative and strength-based approaches.\nOutside the clinical setting, I enjoy knitting socks and napping with my Shiba-Inu. I have a curious mind about learning about your story, so feel free to contact me for a free 15-minute consultation (or to see a photo of my dog!). I will be accepting clients for online appointments. As a practicum student, I will see clients under the supervision of Judy Lui, Msc, CCC, RP. and MacGyver Kou, Msc, RP.",

Life problems and intense emotions are valid and worthy of compassionate exploration.\nI am drawn to positive approaches that help you safely express yourself and your problems, and that lay the groundwork for sustainable and meaningful change.
